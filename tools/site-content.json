Professional background Our work focuses on the engineering details that make security-critical systems dependable: correct protocol handling, careful key management decisions, predictable client behavior, and clear interfaces between apps and services. Smartcard/NFC-enabled applications for Windows and Android Secure authentication and validation flows Encryption-focused application logic and secure data handling REST APIs and backend services supporting verification use cases How we work We prioritize clarity and correctness: define requirements, model the threat surface, implement with testable boundaries, and keep operational concerns (logging, auditing, failure modes) in view from day one. Security-aware design choices and documented assumptions Hands-on development and pragmatic problem-solving Attention to reliability, edge cases, and integration constraints Maintainable codebases and clean interfaces Focus areas Typical engagements involve building secure client applications, integrating NFC/smartcard readers, designing APIs for validation/verification, and delivering systems that behave predictably under real-world conditions.
